## Problem

Creating npm packages is awesome but setting up the build tools every time is exhausting and not productive.

## Solution

With Create Package you don't need to configure Babel, Rollup, Flow or TypeScript.<br>
They are preconfigured and hidden behind a single dependency.

Just create a project and start coding. You don't have to worry how to set up the build tools and update them.

## Why Use This?

If you want to create a npm package but don't want to configure build tools you should use Create Package. You will get everything you need to create modern npm packages:
- Latest JavaScript features with Babel
- Optional TypeScript and Flow support
- Node and Web packages
- Snapshot testing with Jest
- Assistant while developing with ESLint and TSLint

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install Create Package once globally:

```
npm install -g create-package
```
Create Package support `Node >= 4` and `npm >= 3`. You can use [n](https://github.com/tj/n) or [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to switch Node versions between different projects.

## Usage

To create a new package run:
```
create-package my-awesome-package
cd my-awesome-package
```
This will create a new directory called `my-awesome-package` inside the current working directory.<br>
Inside this directory, we will create a simple initial project structure with our only dependency `package-scripts` installed.

```
my-awesome-package
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ Readme.md
â””â”€â”€ src
 Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
 Â Â  â””â”€â”€ index.test.js
```

Once the installation is done, you can run some commands inside the project folder:

### `npm test --watch` or `yarn test --watch`

This will run the Jest test runner in watch mode.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

This will compile all your files and creates a UMD bundle if you want to support the web.

### `npm run check` or `yarn run check`

This will run ESLint to check for common errors. We don't want to stay in your way while hacking. Please feel free to open an issue if a linting rule annoys you.

If you have TypeScript or Flow installed we also check for type errors with this command.

## Converting to a Custom Setup

If youâ€™re a power user and you arenâ€™t happy with the default configuration, you can "eject" from the tool and use it as a boilerplate generator.

Running `npm run eject` copies all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Rollup, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. Commands like `npm start` and `npm run build` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, youâ€™re on your own.

## Philosophy

- **One Dependency** â€” Nice developer experience and easy way to update your build tools.

- **No configuration needed** â€” We want you to focus on creating awesome packages so we will handle the configuration for you.

- **Latest JS Features** â€” You can use the latest JS features and we will compile them down to support older environments.

- **Types with Flow and TS** â€” Easily add support for TypeScript and Flow.

- **No Lock-In:** â€” You can "eject" to a custom setup at any time. Run a single command, and all the configuration and build dependencies will be moved directly into your project, so you can pick up right where you left off.

## Inspiration

### Create React App

Create Package is heavily inspired and copied from Create React App. Check it out if you want to get started with React!
